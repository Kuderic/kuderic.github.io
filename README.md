# What is this website?
I made this website for a web development course. Since I rehosted this to github pages which has no backend, some of the features (namely account creation) were modified to retain site functionality.

This website is a mock-up of an e-commerce website which provides League of Legends in exchange for money. Elo boosting is a service in which the buyer pays to have somebody else who is really good at the game play on their account to raise theri rank. There  are many elo boosting websites on the internet which provide similar services to what my website does.

Note: My website doesn't actually work. It's just for fun.

# Features
Extensive use of JavaScript and jQuery (see boost.php)
CSS made from scratch
Customized Bootstrap file for form styling
