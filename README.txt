I made this website for my highschool web development class.
Since I rehosted this to github pages which has no backend, some of the features
(account creation) were modified to retain functionality.

----------------------Features of my website----------------------
Extensive use of JavaScript and jQuery (see boost.php)
CSS made from scratch
Customized Bootstrap file for form styling
Account creation
	Checks if account already exists (create_account.php)
SQL Database for storing accounts and orders
Validator.js (allows further form control and validation. see register_page.php)
Tooltips.js (register_page.php) and slick.js (reviews.php)
Responsive page design (page will adjust to browser resolution)
